# REMWaste-Code-Challenge
In this app, I redesign the look and feel of the garden waste skip page to maintain its ecstatic user interface and keeping its functionality intact. I created a new repository in my github account and clone it into my local repository.
I use the create-react-app boilerplate, install node and its dependencies, create different folders in the source folder to store my data and image. I populate the data folder with the object from the provided link, dynamically call the data using props.
I styled the project in the index.css file to give it a good UI (user interface), and more.
